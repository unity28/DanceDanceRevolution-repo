# Mod Luigi per DDRMM

# after extracting the .bin mdl files and converting them into .obj, visualized in blender they look to be like a disorganized sequence of coordinates. Upon this issue,
# i decided to try a way around this, by exporting a 3d model with the same amount of vertexes into an .obj, and then convert that file into a .bin and add it to the
# game files.
